`%fastlogin_status%`. In BungeeCord environments, the status of a player will be delivered with a delay after the player
already successful joined the server. This takes about a couple of milliseconds. In this case the value
will be `Unknown`.

## How to install

### Spigot/Paper

1. Download and install ProtocolLib/ProtocolSupport
2. Download and install FastLogin (or `FastLoginBukkit` for newer versions)
3. Set your server in offline mode by setting the value `onlinemode` in your server.properties to false

### BungeeCord/Waterfall or Velocity

Install the plugin on both platforms, that is proxy (BungeeCord or Velocity) and backend server (Spigot).

1. Activate proxy support in the server configuration
   * This is often found in `spigot.yml` or `paper.yml`
2. Restart the backend server
3. Now there is `allowed-proxies.txt` file in the FastLogin folder of the restarted server
    * BungeeCord: Put your `stats-id` from the BungeeCord config into this file
    * Velocity: On plugin startup the plugin generates a `proxyId.txt` inside the plugins folder of the proxy
4. Activate ip forwarding in your proxy config
5. Check your database settings in the config of FastLogin on your proxy
    * The proxies only ship with a limited set of drivers where Spigot supports more. Therefore, these are supported:
    * BungeeCord: `com.mysql.jdbc.Driver` for MySQL/MariaDB
    * Velocity: `fastlogin.mariadb.jdbc.Driver` for MySQL/MariaDB
    * Note the embedded file storage SQLite is not available
    * MySQL/MariaDB requires an external database server running. Check your server provider if there is one available
   or install one.
6. Set proxy and Spigot in offline mode by setting the value `onlinemode` in your `config.yml` to false
7. You should *always* configure the firewall for your Spigot server so that it's only accessible through your proxy
   * This is also the case without this plugin
